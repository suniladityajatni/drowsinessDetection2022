# Drowsiness Detection System

* This is a python based app to detect if the person sitting in front of the camera is feeling drowsy,if yes then a alaraming sound will be played.
* This can be used to reduce road accidents that occur due to drowsiness.
* I used pretrained models from dlib to get facial landmarks and do the prediction.
* Steps to Run:
  
  1.Install Requirements : `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  
  2.Launch the app: `python app.py`
